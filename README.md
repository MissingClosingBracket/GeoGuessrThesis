Exploring hedging strategies for multiple players in Geoguessr: A study of centrality in geospatial networks

# Motivation and Objective
The online game Geoguessr has increased in popularity over the last year. One of the game modes lets two teams of multiple players contest against each other in pinpointing the position of a random location on Earth that is covered by Google Street View. The team that gets closest to the location wins the round. During each round, it is common for the team members to discuss a hedging strategy for their guesses. To this day, the hedging strategies of the teams vary for each round. For example, some teams try to make their guesses cover an entire country or region.

This thesis seeks to explore, implement, test, and reflect upon one or more hedging strategies while answering the questions: “How can the optimal hedging strategy for multiple players in Geoguessr be defined?” and “Which algorithms and calculations can be used to implement such hedging strategies?”.

The thesis more generally studies the concept of centrality in spatial networks, with possible geospatial applications apart from Geoguessr. I plan to define one or more hedging strategies with existing and customized algorithms within network theory. Each strategy will be presented, argued for, implemented, experimentally tested, statistically compared to other approaches, and reflected upon.
